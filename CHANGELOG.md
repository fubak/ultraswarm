# Changelog

All notable changes to ultraswarm are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project aims to follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

_v0.4 in progress — see `docs/plans/2026-06-08-ultraswarm-v0.4.md`._

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-08

### Added
- **Per-run token accounting.** Phase 4 reports now end with a token-accounting
  block: measured Claude orchestration + QA tokens vs. measured external-CLI
  coding tokens, plus a clearly-labelled "Claude work offloaded" proxy estimate
  (never presented as an exact measured "tokens saved"). A new `cli_tokens`
  schema field captures each CLI's self-reported usage (best-effort); the
  Workflow sums it across all attempts and returns `external_tokens`.

### Fixed
- **Plugin manifest conflict.** `marketplace.json` no longer double-declares
  `skills` alongside `plugin.json` component discovery, which caused a load
  error on `/reload-plugins`. The plugin now installs and activates cleanly.
- Bumped the plugin version across both manifests.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-08

### Added
- **CLI-selection config.** `/ultraswarm config` interactive builder probes
  installed CLIs and writes a roster config; global
  `~/.claude/ultraswarm.config.json` + optional per-repo `ultraswarm.config.json`
  (project overrides global), with `enabled` allowlist and per-CLI `overrides`
  (`invocation`, `timeoutMs`, `specialty`, `alternate`).
- **droid** enabled in the worker roster (`droid exec`; requires a Factory
  subscription).

### Fixed
- **Per-CLI timeouts** are now honored via `timeouts[cli]` (the Workflow
  previously applied a single global timeout, so the registry's per-CLI budgets
  and `overrides.timeoutMs` were silently ignored).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-08

### Added
- Initial release of the `ultraswarm` Claude Code plugin: Claude orchestrates
  external AI coding CLIs (codex, gemini, grok, agy, droid, opencode) as workers
  in isolated git worktrees — decompose, author a Workflow, tiered QA, and
  Claude-only merge; the CLIs write the code.
- Phase 0 decomposition with CLI health + write probes and base-tree gate
  verification; per-run Workflow template (worktree implement → tiered QA);
  inline sequential merge; final report.
- Tiered QA: routine tasks get mechanical gates + one diff review; high-risk
  tasks get a 2-CLI competition, judge panel, and 3-lens adversarial verify.
- Packaged as a single-plugin marketplace (`.claude-plugin/`), MIT licensed,
  with README, design spec, implementation plan, and CLI verification registry.
